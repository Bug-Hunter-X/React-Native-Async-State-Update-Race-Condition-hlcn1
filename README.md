This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in React Native related to asynchronous operations and state updates. The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code that results in a potential race condition where `setState` is called after the component has unmounted. This leads to a console warning or error. The `bugSolution.js` provides a solution using a `mounted` flag to prevent state updates after unmounting. This example highlights the importance of handling asynchronous operations correctly within component lifecycles to avoid such subtle, yet disruptive, errors.
